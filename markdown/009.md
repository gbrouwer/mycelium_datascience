#h3 9.1 - Introduction
#pg New machine learning algorithms used to be introduced at a breathtaking pace. However, these more recent algorithms were typically built off the core existing algorithms, tweaking certain aspects to mitigate known issues. The tweaks made the application area of these algorithms narrower, making it harder for researchers and engineers to pick the correct algorithm for the right problem. This issue was resolved partially when neural networks once again became the sweetheart algorithm of AI. This time though, advances in hardware and software meant they truly started outperforming their conventional counterparts. More importantly, they offered a more general-purpose machine learning algorithm: a one-size-fits-all, accelerating their application to many different real-world domains. As stated above, this did come with a price: neural networks are inherently complex, and therefore it will be harder to grasp how they accomplish their high performance. The mapping of the algorithmic objective (see the previous chapter) and class/type of algorithm is not necessarily one-to-one. For example, there are many regression methods, ranging from linear regression to deep belief neural networks. Below is a very non-exhaustive list of the most common machine learning algorithms and the primary algorithmic objectives we typically use them for.
